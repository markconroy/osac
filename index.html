          <h2>Diving in Banager</h2>
          <p>Founded in 2021, Offaly Sub Aqua Club is a community organisation that promotes the sport of scuba
            diving, and snorkelling in the heart of Ireland. Based in Banagher, Co. Offaly on the banks of the River
            Shannon, Offaly SAC is a long-standing affiliate member of Diving Ireland (Comhairle Fó-Thuinn - CFT,
            formerly the Irish Underwater Council). Our diving members are trained and certified to a CMAS International
            Diver Training Standard.</p>

          <h2>Scuba for everyone</h2>
          <p>Our club actively dives, and engages with the diving community, sharing our knowledge, and experience with
            divers, and non-divers of all ages. Our members meet regularly to train, and to explore the depths of the
            River Shannon, and other bodies of water both in and around Ireland, and far abroad. We always have fun, and
            we’ve discovered ancient treasures on occasion too!</p>

          <p>As an active club, Offaly SAC regularly runs a snorkelling school from our waterside clubhouse, where
            our members teach and supervise young divers. Our experienced scuba divers also work with An Garda Síochana,
            and the Irish Coast Guard on occasion to offer assistance in search and recovery.</p>

              <p>That's great that you're interested in joining our diving club! Simply get in touch with us through
                email or through one of our social media channels, and we'd be glad to walk you through what's involved.
                We organise regular scuba diver training each year, where we'll start you off with a try-a-dive session
                in our local swimming pool. We want to make sure you're comfortable with the sport, and for you to get a
                feel for what to expect - before diving in too deep!</p>

              </summary>
              <p>We organise regular scuba diver training each year. You'll need to be competent swimmer, and once you
                pass a try-a-dive session (to ensure you're comfortable with the sport), you are then ready to be
                considered as a member. We'll work closely with you throughout a confined water training for 7-10 weeks
                in our local swimming pool, with open water training to follow (usually in the River Shannon). We're
                affiliated with Diving Ireland, and CMAS, and all our training standards follow the CMAS international
                diver training standards and procedures.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Your annual membership costs approximately €220, which includes our club membership, CMAS membership,
                and dive accident insurance cover. We'll provide you with diving equipment during your confined water
                training in our local swimming pool, but you'll be required to purchase your own diving gear for open
                water training. Scuba diving equipment can vary in price (either new or second hand), and we can help
                you with knowledge and advice to point you in the right direction.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>We're an active club, and we dive most weekends, and often mid-week during the summer months. Always
                weather permitting of course! Our clubhouse is next to the River Shannon in Banagher, and we often dive
                there to teach, train, and to have a lot of fun! We often travel around Ireland, and plan diving
                holidays abroad each year too!</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Absolutely! The path for snorkelling members is a similar process to scuba divers (without the
                try-a-dive session). Membership costs are €70 per year (€50 discounted price for junior divers), and
                you'll need to purchase your own snorkelling equipment (e.g. mask and fins) for open water training. If
                you're a keen snorkeller, get in touch, and we'll be able to give you more information.</p>
